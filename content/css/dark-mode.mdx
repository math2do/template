description: dark mode in css using variables

Dark mode is achieved by manipulating variables in css. Here are the steps needed to make dark mode:

- declare color variables in root of the project which will be used by referencing them in the body.

```css
html {
  foreground: '#fdfsdf';
  muted-foreground: '#fdfsdf';
  muted: '#fsfs';
}
```

- Override the default light colors by dark variants, if `html` has class `dark`.

```css
html.dark {
  foreground: '#dark-color';
  muted-foreground: '#dark-color';
  muted: '#dark-color';
}
```

- Now using javascript, add or remove the class `dark` from tag `html`. So the idea is that, since variables are used for coloring the body, we can ovverride these variables by adding or removing class `dark` from tag `html`.
